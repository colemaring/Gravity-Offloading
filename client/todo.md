NOW

pass websockets context to other components that need the data

python script doesnt need to exist bc esp32 can send data over websockets wirelessly to
ipv4 of pc:3000 and do the average calculation and such on-board

focus:

1. on tuesday, creating meaningful test to see if metal interfence will be an issue
2. modify client.ino to replace python script and send directly wireless over WS
3. compute vector and graph on website
